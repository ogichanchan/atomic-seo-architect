1.  **Plugin Name:** Atomic SEO Architect
2.  **Short Description:** A unique PHP-only WordPress utility. A atomic style seo plugin acting as a architect. Focused on simplicity and efficiency.
3.  **Detailed Description:** Atomic SEO Architect is a lightweight, PHP-only WordPress plugin designed to provide essential SEO controls with a focus on simplicity and efficiency. It acts as an "architect" for your site's SEO, allowing both global settings and granular control over individual posts and pages.

    **Key Features:**

    *   **Global SEO Settings:** Configure site-wide defaults for SEO title prefix/suffix, a fallback meta description, and global `noindex` or `nofollow` directives for search engines. These settings are managed via a dedicated "Atomic SEO Architect Settings" page under the WordPress 'Settings' menu.
    *   **Per-Post/Page Overrides:** Gain precise control by setting custom SEO titles, meta descriptions, robots directives (`noindex`/`nofollow`), and canonical URLs directly within a meta box on the post and page edit screens. These individual settings override the global defaults.
    *   **Dynamic Title Management:** The plugin intelligently filters WordPress's document title, applying your custom SEO title, global prefix/suffix, or falling back to default WordPress titles as needed.
    *   **Automated Meta Tag Output:** Automatically inserts the correct meta description, robots meta tags, and canonical URL links into your site's `<head>` section, respecting the hierarchy of post-specific settings over global settings.
    *   **"PHP-Only" Philosophy:** Built entirely in PHP without external CSS or JavaScript files for its core functionality, adhering to a minimalist approach for maximum efficiency and reduced footprint.
    *   **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides clear settings and input fields within the WordPress admin, including inline CSS for a consistent and clean user experience.

    Atomic SEO Architect empowers you to manage your site's fundamental SEO elements effectively, ensuring your content is optimized for search engines with a minimal, performant solution.
